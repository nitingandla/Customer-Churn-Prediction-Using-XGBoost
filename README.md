# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-XGBoost
Built a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn using Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost. The model helps businesses take proactive retention measures by analyzing customer behavior and engagement patterns. Key features include customer tenure, monthly charges, support interactions, contract type, payment method, and satisfaction score. The project includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, evaluation, saving the trained model, and a deployment-ready function to predict churn probability for new customers.
